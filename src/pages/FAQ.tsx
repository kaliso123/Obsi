      question: 'How often should I visit the dentist?',
      answer: 'We recommend visiting every 6 months for routine cleanings and check-ups. However, some patients with gum disease or other oral health issues may need more frequent visits. During your consultation, we\'ll create a personalized schedule based on your individual needs.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What should I expect during my first visit?',
      answer: 'Your first visit will include a comprehensive oral examination, digital X-rays if needed, and a thorough cleaning. We\'ll review your medical history, discuss any concerns you have, and create a personalized treatment plan. The entire appointment typically takes 60-90 minutes.'

      question: 'How long do dental implants last?',
      answer: 'With proper care and maintenance, dental implants can last 20-30 years or even a lifetime. The success rate for dental implants is over 95%. Regular dental check-ups, good oral hygiene, and avoiding habits like smoking will help ensure the longevity of your implants.'
    },
    {
      question: 'What payment options do you offer?',
      answer: 'We accept cash, credit cards, and most insurance plans. We also offer CareCredit financing for treatment costs, which provides flexible payment plans with low or no interest options. Our financial coordinator will work with you to find the best payment solution for your budget.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How can I maintain good oral health at home?',
      answer: 'Brush your teeth twice daily with fluoride toothpaste, floss daily, and use an antimicrobial mouthwash. Avoid sugary and acidic foods, don\'t use tobacco products, and replace your toothbrush every 3-4 months. Regular dental check-ups are also essential for maintaining optimal oral health.'
